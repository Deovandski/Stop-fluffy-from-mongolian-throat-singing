# Monitor Fluffy
![](Resources/App.png)

A "complex" software designed to record audio and play sounds at a random interval to prevent Fluffy from bothering the neighbors when she is by herself.

# How to Use it
Download the msi from the release tab, install it then open the app. If you see a "Ready to Roll" then just click Start Monitor, otherwise see messages on screen to check what is broken.

# Did you actually made an app just for your doggo?
Pretty much. I was not going to pay github for a private repo for what boils down to 6 hours of coding, so it became public. Plus, if this app succeeds in its purpose, then I am gonna save myself a pretty penny by not taking Fluffy to Pet daycare.

# License, and lawyer talk
MIT License so you can fork at your heart's content. Open an issue if it is repo related, otherwise hit me up on FB.
